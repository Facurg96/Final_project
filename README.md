## Overview

A natural language processing (NLP) project to create a multi-label system able to classify e-commerce products automatically. This project will result in an API service that is backed by an NLP model that will classify the textual elements of a product record (description, summary etc).

## Introduction

The automation of tasks in the ecommerce world can be of great help to the market, since it focuses the customer on the purchase and not on the configuration of the search or sale.
In this case, it is required to automate tasks in the process of selling a product, adding a predefined category that corresponds to the product they are selling, acquiring the information of the title and the description of the product.
